## 🌟 Core Message

This session dives deep into forgiveness as the ultimate act of self-liberation. Bashar makes a crucial distinction: forgiving someone doesn't condone their actions—it frees *you* from continuing to abuse yourself through resentment. When you hold onto the need for revenge or punishment, you remain energetically shackled to the very trauma you're trying to escape. True forgiveness is simply choosing to no longer let the past define your present.

## 💡 Key Insights

• **It takes a victim to make a victim** — Understanding that those who cause harm are often acting from their own unhealed trauma doesn't excuse the behavior, but it does open the door to compassion

• **Anxiety = excitement filtered through fear** — They can't coexist. You toggle between them based on which belief system you're running

• **Follow your passion for its own sake** — Seeking external validation (likes, compliments) gives your power away. The world can't validate you; only you can

• **Knowledge and behavior are synonymous** — "What you know to be true is in your behavior. You don't think about it. You don't wonder about it. You just do it"

• **The grays are mutated humans** — From a parallel Earth that destroyed its environment. Mantis beings oversee the hybridization program as "keepers of emotions" the grays gave up

• **All emotions are guidance systems** — Anxiety isn't bad; it's your energy saying "hey, you're filtering me through a belief that doesn't align with who you really are"

## 💬 Notable Q&A Exchanges

**Q:** *"My dad abused me physically. Last time I saw him, he watched a movie about abuse and said 'How can she abuse her own child?' like he'd forgotten. How is that possible?"*
**A:** "He lives in present. Do you wish to hold on to that or let it go? ... It takes a victim to make a victim. Being in fear, being victimized himself, he didn't know how to express connection and love in a positive way."

**Q:** *"Why did I choose a speech impediment as a soul?"*
**A:** "It forces you to communicate more strongly in other ways, doesn't it?"

**Q:** *"How do I work on forgiveness?"*
**A:** "You don't work on it. You just let it go. ... Forgiveness is freedom. You are no longer shackled to the idea of a so-called past that is simply no longer your past. If you become a different person, you have a different past."

**Q:** *"How do I develop inner joy and synchronize heart and mind?"*
**A:** "Behave like you know it's true. Knowledge and action are synonymous. What you know to be true, you just do."
