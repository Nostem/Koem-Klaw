And as you do this and move forward more holistically in absolute trust and knowingness that everything in your life works and everything is there for a reason, your reason. And respond to everything. From that knowingness that it can only be there for one reason, to benefit you, to support you, to reflect love to you, to give you an opportunity to experience challenges that allow you to discover more of who you are when you approach everything from that same perspective. It will reveal itself. It will unfold in that way. You will see that it is so. It will become innate. It will become first nature to move to step and to see everything not as a goal but as a stepping stone to greater things. Everything is a stepping stone to greater things. Even those things you might think are goals or destinations in life, they are not. They may form markers, demarcations, cycles, beginnings and ends, but they are not ends in that sense. They are not really culminations in that sense. They are only stepping stones. So there is no need to fixate on a certain thing happening in a certain way at a certain time for it all happens at once and it is just a matter of being in the state of being of the vibration of more of yourself to begin to actually sense that to see that to know that as surely as you know your own names as surely as you recognize your own vibration creation. As surely as that it will become first nature for you to recognize the frequency of holism and to move forward in that holistic way with absolute knowingness. It is even beyond faith. It is even beyond belief. It is knowingness. It is an absolute conviction that this is the way it is and that you choose the things that excite you the most because that's who you are. And because knowing that's who you are, there is no other choice. No other choice but to be who you are. To act on the things that reflect who you are. To move in the holistic way that is representative of who you are. No other choice. Our society has functioned this way synchronistically now for quite some time. Your society will begin to do so more and more and more and more. Do not be hard on yourselves. You do not have to allow yourself to think that this must happen tomorrow or the next day. Be at peace and be in love with what is happening now. Even if the thing that is happening now is not what you prefer, the thing that is happening now that is not what you prefer is going to be what allows you to understand more clearly what it is you do prefer and to be in the state by comparison of what it is you do prefer. But the only way to use what you don't prefer in that manner is to treat it as a stepping stone that is part of your path, part of what you prefer instead of an interruption in it, instead of an obstacle in it, instead of a detour in it, instead of a diversion in it. What you don't prefer is simply an opportunity to understand more clearly who and what you are as a holistic being. Because again, the great paradox of enlightenment, the great paradox of the expansion of awareness and consciousness is that you become not less aware of negative, you become more aware of the negative because all that is is everything positive and negative. So the closer you become to the vibration of all that is, the more aware you become of the choices, of the possibilities, of the opportunities to choose negative reality. But you also realize the great holistic power you have in choosing what you prefer in the positive side. But the only way you can give yourself the power to choose what you prefer is to at least allow what you don't prefer to be an equally valid choice, equally capable of being chosen. So that all choices are equal. And no one choice is being given more energy, more focus, more credence in a judgmental sense than another. A preference is not in that sense amplifying any particular thing. It is just a neutral recognition of what vibration is truly reflective of who you truly are. And to simply be aware of negative choices will not make them come to pass. To be afraid of them will for to be afraid of them is to give them energy, to reinforce the negative patterns, the negative vibrations, and to fixate on that which you say you don't want. So even though you may see more opportunities to look at the negative as you expand in your enlightenment, fear not those opportunities. Fear not that increase in the opportunity to see what you don't prefer. It will give you more opportunity to choose what you do prefer if you validate it as a stepping stone that brought you to where you are to have this recognition to have this realization at this place in time. At every moment with every step at every moment with every step at every moment with every step count your blessings. Bless yourself. No, you are blessed just by being you are blessed. Less attitude, more gratitude. Take a deep breath and feel the greatness of your being. Feel the wholeness of your being. Feel the release and the relief to know that you are on this journey because it is a great adventure and a great opportunity to discover more of who you really are. and to be shocked and stunned by that discovery and enlightened and excited to discover who you really are. The great secret of forgetting is so that you could remember and delight in the experience of discovery. So do not condemn, do not damn the forgetfulness for forgetfulness is necessary for there to be surprise. So surprise yourself by loving that you have forgotten so that you can learn who you are in a new way, a unique way that allows all that is to experience itself in a unique way. Your world will eventually become as synchronistically aligned as ours. Everything is synchronicity. But you have the opportunity to experience the synchronicity you prefer, the reflections you prefer. You can use us as a guide. You can use us as a template. But remember never to sacrifice your own uniqueness. For you are equal to us in every way. Because we are all children of creation. And creation is mother and father to us all. We will take a moment to address one specific issue that we have been asked to address which has a lot to do with the idea of functioning holistically. And this is an issue on your planet now that has to do with exchange of information and the idea of its connection to money. Many people on your planet are going through transformations having to do with the concept of information. Many people on your planet are hungry for information. There have been expressions on your planet that all information ought to be free. The great secret is is that all information is already free. As we have said, information like fruit is already free if you pluck it directly from the tree. But if you ask another to perform the service of plucking it for you, there is nothing negative about those individuals asking for the idea of money in exchange for the service. Money is not an evil. Many individuals have completely misunderstood us when we talk about the idea of abundance simply being the ability to do what you need to do when you need to do it. This idea, while it opens the door to other ways that things can occur synchronistically without necessarily involving money, does not in any way, shape, or form exclude money as one of the ways in which abundance can be expressed on your planet. All of our tools and techniques are always inclusive, never exclusive. Some individuals even go so far as to attempt to convince other individuals that there is something inherently wrong with money as if in and of itself it had some sort of negative vibration. It does not. This is a complete misunderstanding and misinterpretation of everything we have said. Allow yourselves to understand you are changing and there will come a day when you may not require that particular symbol of abundance anymore. However, at this time, many of you are still functioning within a frame of reference wherein what you call money is a valid form of exchange equal to any other form of valid exchange with respect to the concept of abundance. Do not discount it or you are discounting your own abundance and your own ability to allow that form of abundance to come to you as easily as any other form can come. All must be equal. To express the idea that one form of abundance should be excluded and devalued over others as if that were more spiritual again is a complete misunderstanding of what your reality is about and what you are learning. And again, yes, you will change in time, but you require to create many other kinds of systems and many other kinds of changes before you can allow certain forms of tool on your planet to truly fade away when you truly no longer need them. Many individuals now who create an insistence that you must force yourself to not use certain forms of exchange, certain forms of abundance, otherwise you are not behaving spiritually again have completely missed the point. And not only that, such statements are absolutely disingenuous and hypocritical because most of those people, I guarantee you, will still buy food, will still want a paycheck for their job, will still pay rent, and yet they make exceptions in certain areas for some arbitrary reason in their mind. If anyone in that sense were even going to have the idea of a validation to make such a claim that such a thing should be unnecessary, they would first thus then need to go to their places of employment and go to their respective bosses and refuse to take any money for what they do. They would go to your grocery stores and explain to the people that they are going to walk out with groceries without paying. Thus then if they themselves will allow themselves to abandon all intake of money and all outlay of money, they would at least have in their minds some true justification from their perspective about talking about the ability to function without that particular tool. But none of them do. Therefore, we simply suggest without judgment and with unconditional love that you all understand that there are ways to work together that are win-win situations for all and to not move forward in fear that you cannot access what you need. For information is free and the tools we share with you give you the great capability as permission slips to access everything you need. You do not need desperation or fear that you will not have what you need as a tool just because you may not have money at a certain point to get it to pay for the service of it being delivered to you. But as long as you understand that all things are equal, then all of you can work together and find out ways of trading, of bargaining, of bartering, of exchanging, of using money, of using synchronicity, of using gifting, of using all the forms of abundance in ways that allow win-win situations for all, but not at the discounting of any form of it. Or you have discounted the whole principle. That is all we will say about that. We will at this time conclude this transmission with the continuation of sharing questions and dialogue in whatever way, shape or form or subject you so desire. Happy day, Bashar. >> And to you, good day. >> Um, I want you to help me to solve this puzzle. >> Speak up. Speak up clearly. >> I will. I want you to help me to solve this puzzle that has been following me for the past >> a puzzle. >> Yeah. >> All right. >> It's been following me for the past 25 years. >> Like a little doggy. Uh yeah, I can say that. >> Oh, all right. >> It's been in a form of a message. Um a set of numbers of three numbers. >> Yes. Which are what? >> Do you want to know the numbers? >> Yes, please. >> Three, six, seven. >> Yes. >> And I've seen them every time, every day for the past 25 years. Seven, eight, 10 times a day. >> All right. Congratulations. >> Um thank you. I would like to know what it means. The idea for many of you is that you see repetitions of numbers quite often as part of the synchronicity in your lives. The idea is a reflection to show you exactly how powerful you are at creating synchronicity. So you set up easily recognizable patterns of numbers as markers to show you that you are still on your path. >> It's just like I'm on the right track. >> Yes, >> I >> and it shows you how easily you can manifest. All you need to do is apply the same degree of certainty of knowing you'll see those numbers again and again and again and again to everything else in your life that is representative of what you prefer and allow that pattern that template to overlay those things so that they can also be attracted to you with the same ease of synchronicity that the numbers appear. >> Okay, >> it is showing you how readily and how rapidly you can manifest. >> I can see that. I also uh see in the circuits I also related to the these three numbers and probably those are the numbers that I have to >> all right >> mostly >> they may be the ones you will start working with on an individual basis after you do the first three days of all 15 in order >> correct >> so play with that and see what happens >> I will play that >> and maybe your number will come up >> it will yeah um I'm curious um in your society since you seem to have all the answers for >> No, no, no. We have the answers that work for us. >> Okay? >> You have all the answers that work for you. We share some of these answers, but we do not have all the answers. There are many things we do not know, but we do not know what they are. >> Exactly. Okay. I'm curious. What kind of obstacles do you face in your society? >> We face no obstacles. We only face exciting challenges because we choose to define everything that occurs in that format and so only experience them in that way. Nothing to us is ever defined as an obstacle which implies it doesn't belong. >> So you always live in a blissful state. >> Absolutely. Why not? >> I love it. That's >> our reality is composed of nothing but synchronous events. No one plans anything. We just all show up at the right place at the right time for whatever has to happen. And remember, we are telepathically bonded. We know exactly what is going on all the time with everyone on our world. >> That's great. >> You follow? >> Yes, I do. >> Now, this usually comes across simply as a sense of feeling or guidance. Almost like simply being carried by the currents in a deep lake. It's not something that we intellectually understand as in, oh, I understand exactly what that person is thinking. I understand exactly what that person is thinking. It is usually left on automatic, but we let ourselves be pulled by the currents because we know what they are and we trust them and we know they will only guide us to where exactly we need to be at exactly the right time to interact with exactly whom we need to interact with at exactly that moment. >> That is beautiful. >> You are heading toward this. So let your bliss carry you in this direction through your grounded actions that are reflective of your joy >> and thank you for your guidance. >> Yes. >> Thank you. >> Thank you. >> Hello Bashar. I knew you good day. >> Um, your higher perspective allows you to see things that we may not be able to see just as yet. Um, it made me start thinking about that maybe perspective was infinite and if perspective is infinite at that level of frequency is there are things obviously there are things that we can't see. So my question my my first question is is does the universe expand to infinite perspective or are there several universes or millions? >> Well, there are several universes. You could call it a multiverse as many of you have begun to do. Nevertheless, in totality, creation is infinite. Even though different universes may have finite experiences within it. But remember the finite is subject to the infinite because the infinite by definition contains the concept of the finite whereas the concept of the finite by definition does not contain the concept of infinity. Did that make sense in your language? >> Yes. Creation is infinite. >> Right. >> Different universes may not be. They may have a finite experience. >> Does that make sense? >> I see. Um >> because they are within infinity. >> So then if if infinity cannot be cannot be experienced, does it exist? >> It does. Okay. The closest however to the idea of experiencing infinity is what we term all that is. Whereas the concept of the one which is also in a sense all that is is undifferentiated. It's just one and as such it actually has no experience of itself as infinity. It takes recognition of the self to experience the idea of the infinite and therefore only all that is the first separation from the one can experience its own infinite quality. But it also knows that true infinity cannot actually be experienced because only the one is truly infinite but the one by definition does not have experience. >> I see. >> Does that make sense in your life? >> It does make sense to me actually. Yes. All right. Um, >> you must be more messed up than I thought. [clears throat] >> You are crazy just like us because we understand it too. >> Uh, my second question is uh you have come to us in this form because you want us to follow the message and not >> No, I do not want you to follow the message. >> I want you to do what makes you happy. We simply suggest certain things that could help you and assist you in this endeavor, but we do not want you to do anything >> except for you to be you. So, it's up to you to determine what you would like to do. >> Okay, let me rephrase that. >> Thank you. >> Um, >> it helps to be specific. Um the point here is that >> the message that you are suggesting for us >> is more important than the messenger. >> Absolutely. >> Um >> because experience is the only reality not the things in it. >> Exactly. So you have come to us in a >> by invitation >> by invitation in this form as as a channel >> at this time. at this time >> as a channel and the entity channeling through the channel. >> Um >> and in time members of our society including myself will actually have the opportunity to meet many of you physically face to face. But right now this is a telepathic contact between myself and my past self so to speak >> right. Um we have had uh teachers so to speak that have come to us in physical form that were that we perceived you know as human because they were in physical form. My question is this >> um Jesus uh the Buddha uh Muhammad >> yes Krishna Voka all of them >> were they extraterrestrial beings? There is some extraterrestrial connection to some of them. But the way you mean it, no. I see. >> Some of them have in their physical form genetic alterations that are connected to estaterrestrial genetics that allow them to function in the way that they did. But the idea in the way you mean it is no. They are not literally extraterrestrials. So, >> but they are representative of beings who are capable of expressing what we refer to as your world spirit, your collective whole spirit and soul of your world. >> Are were they then hybridized? >> Some of them you don't want to say which ones. [laughter] >> The Christ body was hybridized. >> Really? The Buddha body was hybridized. The Krishna body was hybridized. The Boka body was hybridized. Did I mention all of them or Yes. Um my last question is um do you accept volunteers to come back with you anywhere to to your where >> many of you pay visits to our reality in your outof body dream state all the time you just don't remember. >> I see. So there is an open invitation for us to join you in >> Absolutely. And we leave it up to you to figure out right now how to get there. In time, in time, it will be possible on our ships. But right now, many of you are preparing the way and getting used to the idea by visiting in your dream state. And some of you sometimes even take on temporary bodily forms of members of our society and walk among us. But then when you wake up, you disappear. >> H, now that's interesting. Okay. >> Uh, okay. Well, that answers my questions. Thank you so much. >> Pleasant dream. >> Mhm. [laughter] >> Hello, Bashar. >> How are you? Good day. >> Happy Father's Day. >> Thank you, >> Bashar. I'd been working on a a real estate property for some time and then it transitioned. It's in transition right now and I just don't think that all of the questions I'd like to have I'd like to ask have answers to them yet because many decisions haven't been made about it yet. >> All right. >> But >> then you will have fun in the meantime. Yes. >> Yes. >> All right. [laughter] Um, I'd like to know if the if the bank uh that's involved in the this property um is involved at the level where they would try to uh prevent me from taking any action on the property. >> No one can empirically prevent you from doing anything that is representative of your truth. The question for you to investigate is whether you are actually acting on something that is truly out of your joy or out of fear or desperation. Okay. >> Other than that, in a more specific way, that information is no longer available through this terminal at this time. [laughter] >> I knew you were going to say that. >> How psychic of you. >> It is. Um, also, I've been working or trying to work with uh three different people who are investors on this project and uh it's Tom, Rick, and David. And do you have any suggestion as to who might be the best? >> What happened to Harry? [laughter] >> No. No. Harry this time. >> Oh. All right. >> Harry lost his money. >> It is not lost. >> I know. I'm just kidding. >> It is always only simply set aside in a place where it becomes invisible. >> Okay. Well, he's in the process of trying to make it visible again. >> All right. And so >> can you tell me uh which one of the three you think might be more effective on this project? >> That information is not available through this terminal. >> Okay. >> You are asking me to do your homework for you. >> Jeez. >> No, I'm not. >> Yes, you are. >> All right. Bashar, did they repeal the title 24 law? >> Repeat. Did they repeal? Was the Title 24 law repealed? >> It does not need to be. >> Why not? >> Because it will simply be replaced by something else in that the original idea did not really carry full weight anyway. >> Okay. Um Okay. Um can you give me a little bit of information regarding the royal rife machine? >> What do you wish to know? It seems to be a very effective machine for uh chronic illness and uh possibly >> so you are saying it seems to be effective to you. >> Well, I haven't used it yet but >> but you are saying it seems to be effective to you. >> Yes. >> Then you have answered your own question. >> Okay. >> At what point will you incorporate all the things we have talked about to answer your questions on these subjects? >> This is what we mean by holism. You already know that these things need to unfold as part and parcel of you simply acting on whatever you are attracted to act on that is representative of your highest joy. And you do not need to continue to compartmentalize and peacemeal these questions out and divide these things into smaller and smaller and smaller details which only wind up confusing you. >> I didn't realize that you were thinking that I was doing that. Thank you for informing. >> I am not thinking that I'm you're doing it. I know you are doing it. >> [laughter] >> I don't I don't think I am doing it. >> Listen to how you ask the questions and you will see clearly that you are >> all right. >> You are asking for specific details about business ideas that are in that sense well within the purview of you to figure out if you simply act on your joy and you do not need to consult with us. You may wish to attract business consultants in your own reality to help you with these things. But the idea from our point of view, as you already well know, is that if you simply act on your highest joy without fear, then all these things will fall into place in whatever way they need to to serve you best, and you won't have to spend time worrying and wondering whether they will or not. >> And that's what we mean by the idea that you're not quite picking up on the holistic approach. >> Okay. Well, then I'll pick up on it. >> Up to you. >> Okay. Bashar, I saw or read or heard where milk is linked to some type of cancer. or whole milk is linked to possibly breast cancer in women. Is there any truth to that? >> It isn't the milk, it's the toxins. >> Okay. >> So, in that many of your food stuffs on your planet are highly toxic, then in that sense, the answer would be a general yes. >> Okay. All right. I heard most of that. It's the toxins and and I'm sorry, what was the rest of your answer? April was talking to me. The general idea is that most of your food is toxic. >> Okay. >> Therefore, a general yes is in order. But you already know that. Okay. >> So this is an example of what we are talking about. >> Okay. >> When you ask >> does whole milk cause cancer, >> you already know that it's the toxins within and the processing within that creates the disturbance in the cells and not the milk. >> Okay. >> Yes. >> Thank you, Bashar. Now if you wish also for individuals after detoxification the counterpoint to that idea would be the ingestion of natural organic pureed asparagus, avocado and walnuts. >> Okay. >> Which are cancer cures. >> Very good. >> Thank you. >> Thank you. Hello again, Bashar. >> And to you, good day. [laughter] >> Um, I I want to apologize to you and the group for asking a selfish question and beating a dead horse. And but but you know you you've >> we saw in no such speed [laughter] >> but you know you have helped me so so much through my life and you know that I have a total respect for you and everything you say. >> Well you have helped us as well in ways you can't even begin to imagine. >> Thanks. Um so the dead horse I'm about to beat is moving to Santa Monica. >> Oh. All right. >> And >> if you wish to discuss a little bit of St. Monica, go right ahead. >> Um, I I you know, I'm looking back at the convers the original conversation we had and it was a very difficult time in my life and and I always try to incorporate what you say about following your joy. >> Do you? >> No. >> Thank you for your honesty. >> But >> because if you did, you would be living in Santa Monica. >> Okay. So, here's the question. So, >> not that you have to. >> No. But we derive no pleasure out of seeing you suffer by fighting an uphill battle against your own energy and resisting yourself. >> Okay. Um but but just this one little question. >> Yes. Yes. One little question. >> Why didn't I feel joy about that suggestion if that was where I was supposed to be? because you were afraid that it would not lead you to what you wanted. You didn't look at it as a stepping stone. You looked at it as a conclusion. >> Does that answer your question or are you still confused? >> I'm I'm still confused because I I I would think that if I was really supposed to be there, I would have felt the draw and I would have done something. Let me ask you the question in another format. >> Great. >> You say that you are in joy when you are in your channel island area. >> Absolutely. >> Then why is the synchronicity in your reality not simply allowing you to be there and enjoy it? >> I haven't figured that part out yet. >> I just told you why. [laughter] >> But but the concept the concept that I wasn't drawn to Santa Monica, that's what's bothering me. >> I see. But what is it about the ideas you are associating with that area that prevent you from seeing it in the light that it needs to be seen in? What associations are you making to it that prevents you from seeing it as exciting, from seeing it as a stepping stone? That's the question. You are coloring it with conditions based on the idea of experiences that you are not allowing yourself to let go of. >> [sighs] >> Okay. I'm I'm still not getting it, but >> All right. Well, let's just do a simple association. >> Okay. >> What is it that you feel about the idea of living in Santa Monica? >> Yuck. >> Why? >> Because it's it would be leaving the place that brings me the most joy. >> Don't put the condition on it that connects it to the idea of the place that you say you wish. Just look at it as a pure answer to a pure question. >> What is it about Santa Monica? >> It's close to LA. >> And so >> traffic, noise, crime. >> I see. And none of that exists in Channel Island? >> No. >> None. >> Not much. >> I see. So what you are actually saying to us is you cannot bring yourself to believe that you can actually create a bubble reality Santa Monica that is designed for you. You are succumbing to the collective idea of what Santa Monica must be for others and so must be for you as well. >> Uh no I could probably make a bubble reality there. >> Then why didn't you? Well, because I didn't I didn't feel the joy. You say follow your joy and I didn't feel any joy about moving to Santa Monica >> because of the conditions you place on it that does not allow you to respond to the idea in a positive way when we suggested it. In a sense, it was an opportunity to see how you would respond or react to that idea. You reacted in a negative way instead of responding with creative imagination as how it could be representative of a positive thing which would have created a breakthrough that didn't happen. >> Okay. But that window is still open just a little bit. Right. >> Just a little bit. >> All right. I'm going to squeeze through it. >> All right. So, how can you use your creative imagination to respond positively to the idea of living in Santa Monica? Well, I haven't been to Santa Monica in a long time, and I don't know what it's like now. So, I would imagine I would go there and drive around and see what it's like now. >> And >> and if I see anything about it that I like, I'll slow down and check it out. >> Oh, listen to that. >> It's beautiful. It's heaven. [laughter] Do you think that you can bring yourself even before you go there to believe it so that when you go there, you are actually driving in that Santa Monica instead of once again making it conditional? Well, I'll go down there and drive around and well, if I don't know, I see anything that looks promising, I maybe I'll stop and check it out. >> Yeah, I thought I was doing pretty good, too. Um [laughter] >> okay. Okay. So >> the idea is to approach the suggestion from the perspective and the state of being that the Santa Monica that would actually be ideal for you is already there and is the only Santa Monica you can possibly experience when you go there. Not. Well, I'll check this Santa Monica out and maybe the other one maybe the other one will show itself a little bit here and there through the cracks. >> That is not the energy of your preference. >> Okay. So, I'm going to heaven. >> Yes. >> All right. >> And when you understand that no matter where you go, heaven is there, then you'll be able to be wherever you want. because this is just another variation of allowing all choices to be equal and not invalidating them. That's what you're attempting to balance here. Let me give you a little bit of help. >> Okay. [laughter] >> Do you feel the same way about Santa Barbara? >> No. >> You actually enjoy Santa Barbara? >> Oh, no. Santa Barbara's fine. It's, you know, I take it or leave it. >> Take it or leave it. >> Yeah. But compared to the idea of how you thought of Santa Monica, relatively more positive. >> No. >> No. The same. All things pale to Channel Islands. >> Yes. >> All right. [laughter] But here's the key. >> Uhhuh. >> The issue that we are attempting to get across is that Channel Islands is within you, not outside you. And when you can be at home anywhere, you can be home anywhere you wish. Okay, >> let that sink in. >> Okay, >> and remember that when you travel, you are traveling to the reality that is already representative of your joy. If you travel with trepidation, you will not wind up in the appropriate vibrational reality. You must make it an adventure of unprecedented proportions. Okay, I'll >> you'll what? >> I'll do it. >> Thank you. >> Okay. Thank you, Bashar. >> You are [laughter] welcome. >> Bye-bye. >> Hello.
