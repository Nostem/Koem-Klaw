Hello, Bashar. >> And are you good day? >> Oh my goodness. I didn't realize I get this extremely nervous. My heart has been thumping out of my chest. >> You mean extremely excited? >> Excited. Yes. So, I feel like my RPM, whatever you call it, is like 250 miles per hour. >> All right. >> So, um I actually awoke about three years ago. Um and like through a past life regression, I realized I was a mantis being. >> You are what? um that I am a mantis being. >> You are connecting to a mantis being. >> I am connecting to the mantis. >> It's not you. You're connecting to it. >> That's correct. >> All right. Yes, I know. That's correct. >> Yes. And that I come from the Antares. Um >> No, you don't come from >> I come from here. >> You are connecting to Antar. >> Yes, I'm connecting to the Antari system. So, I was wondering what my role is. um um um assisting humanity uh with actually working with the mantis beings and if you can share with us more information that you haven't >> Are you following the formula? >> I am. >> Then you're fulfilling your role. >> Okay. You should see the way I'm dressed and or feel the energy of the way I'm dressed and it will tell you all about it. Um are you able to tell us more about them? Normally I do not dress like this but I was called Ah, >> so can you tell us more about Dementis beings? >> They are the overseers. >> Uhhuh. >> Of the hybridization program. Because the grays at one point decided that they had to give up their emotionality and become a hive mentality in order to accomplish the task because it was so large. They knew they needed someone to guide them. And so in a sense, the mantis beings were well, I'll use your word, hired to guide them. So the mantis beings are the overseers of the hybridization program. I see. >> They had to give up their emotionality to reclaim their emotionality in the hybrids. >> And how are they assisting humanity with that project? >> Am I assisting you? >> Yes. >> Then you know. >> Perfect. Thank you. >> Because my civilization is one of the hybrid civilizations that resulted from the hybridization agenda. >> Okay. Fantastic. Thank you. >> We are helping to make sure of course it's your choice. You do not go down the same path that the grays went down when they were humans on a parallel Earth where they destroyed their reality. >> Got it? >> Remember that the grays are mutated humans. They're not aliens. >> Yes. Yes, they are what became of humanity on a parallel version of Earth that destroyed its environment and had to mutate to survive and could no longer reproduce and so had to use their advanced technology to come to parallel realities such as yours where human DNA was still viable that they could add to their own to create hybrids to perpetuate their society. Okay, >> we are one of those hybrid civilizations and we are helping you to again according to your own choices see that you have an opportunity to not go down the same path as the grays went down on their version of Earth. >> I see. uh because I feel they're extremely heart-based and I I'm like saying this very lightly because they can go deeper and deeper and deeper of the layers of the heart and explain and describe things that are so I guess abstract um to expand our mind. They've been quite informative with my relationship you know with them. So >> yes >> they do seem abstract to most humans in a lot of ways but it's because of the reality that they inhabit. It doesn't always interpret straight across to the understandings of your reality. Nevertheless, they are extremely emotional beings, extremely deeply emotional intelligences, and they have a great deal of intelligence about the idea of the expressions and energies associated with different emotions, which is why the grays utilize them as the overseers. They are the keepers of the emotions that the grays gave up. >> Amazing. Wow. Um, okay. Perfect. I'm going to jump to my more threedimensional question in this on this on this planet. Um, I have always stuttered and I um, you know, and I do every once in a while. I use certain words to kind of guide me from one word to another. So, why did I choose as a soul like speech impediment and how am I able to train myself and others to speak with ease? It forces you to communicate more strongly in other ways, doesn't it? >> Perfect. That's exactly what I always knew. Thank you. Just confirmed it. >> Um, are you able to share anything fascinating that you have not shared yet about the 13 skulls? The 13 crystal skulls. >> One moment. >> Sure. Have you visited what are called the serpent mountains in your area of Ohio? >> On my list. Go. And when you meditate there, you may get some information from one of the skulls that is connected to that culture. >> And is a skull there or it's just there's a connection there? The skull is instructing us to say that the word there is a relative term. Not meaning to be too cryptic, but the skulls are very cryptic. So, are they are they there on a different frequency and we're unable to see them? >> Yes. >> Understood. Fantastic. Um, can you give us, I guess, a step-by-step um, uh, um, example of what the process might look like of actually becoming, I guess, a caretaker of a hybrid child uh, from when we first meet them to everyday interaction. At first, these sanctuaries will be somewhat isolated and only a few humans will be allowed to interact according to the hybrid children's agenda as to what they feel comfortable or important in terms of the way that they should interact with humans at that time. Humans will synchronistically be attracted in small numbers to these sanctuaries. And over time, the numbers will grow as humans and hybrids become more comfortable and familiar with one another. >> I see. Perfect. And what role did the fires that just happened in Maui um I guess play and how can we best support the sovereignty of the land and the people in Maui? All we can do right now is sum up the idea that you are experiencing the consequences of choices that were made that are not necessarily in alignment with stewardship of the land. Got it. Okay. Um you channeled this super wise entity. I can't remember his name or it name. He was very ancient and he's the one who went like this. He said, "Mazani." >> Yes. This was an Anuhat Anuhat, >> the seventh hybrid race. >> Are you able to bring him through? And >> not at this time. >> Understood. Um, okay. This is not a question, but an invitation that came through when I was showering this morning. >> The shower is often a good meditation chamber. >> Yes. And driving. Um I would like to invite you to join hearts with me and if you're able to channel through the praying mantis um energies any messages for >> not at this time. >> Okay. >> But you will have a dream soon. >> Okay. Well, I am so forever grateful and thank you with my unconditional love. >> Our deep appreciation and unconditional love to you as well. Good day. Hi Basha. >> And to you good day. >> Uh my English is second language. So >> my English is not good either. >> Uh sorry if it's difficult for you to understand it. I have a contemporary question. I use Instagram for my work and sometimes I care about how many likes I get and I always want to have compliments or encouragement from people but when I don't get that I feel like I am alone and I feel like uh people forget about me and I don't want to have those feeling inside me how to >> so you are not following your passion for its own sake but for what you think it will get you. You have to follow your passion regardless of what people's response is because there's simply no other choice for you. That's being who you really are. It doesn't matter what other people think or what they give you. You have to follow your passion for its own sake or you're not being pure about it. You're using it as a condition to get feedback to be validated by the outside world. The outside world cannot validate you. You can only validate yourself. So as soon as you start simply doing what you love for its own sake, not because of the feedback you're going to get, then it can expand and more people can find you who will support you. But you can't do it to get the support. You have to support yourself. You have to know that you are valid. >> Okay. Thank you. >> Does that help you? >> Yes, I it did. Then thank you for allowing us to encourage you. >> Our next question is when I get big job I get a lot of pleasure and anxiety even though I want to people to know about me more. I get scared and ended up escaping from those situation and >> all right this is the same thing though you're giving over to the idea of outside validation >> but this pressure made me confuse if I want to do it or not >> you are putting the pressure on yourself you are overwhelming yourself by the way you're thinking about what it is you're doing that's what we're attempting to tell you >> you have to just do what you love to do for its own sake it doesn't matter what other people think about it. >> But it sometimes make me excited also worry at the same time. >> No, not at the same time. You go back and forth. You cannot be excited and be in anxiety at the same time. You are making a choice to leave your excitement and go into anxiety because you have fear-based belief systems about yourself with regard to that situation. Sometimes you will leave that and go back into excitement. We would simply suggest that you remain in excitement instead of shifting into anxiety. But if you do shift into anxiety, ask yourself why. What is the belief you have about yourself in that situation that makes you go into anxiety that makes you afraid of something might happen that you do not prefer? Why do you have that definition? Do you understand? >> Half of it. When you go into anxiety, that's because you have a fear-based belief >> that you think something bad is going to happen. >> Why do you have that belief? >> You have to find out why you're holding on to that belief so you can let it go. >> All anxiety is the result of fear-based beliefs. So, you must have fear-based beliefs about yourself that says that it's more likely than not that something bad is going to happen. >> Okay, I understand. >> All right, >> next question is, when I was little, my dad was abusing me physically. Last time I met him, we were watching a movie and the movie was about Sorry, the movie was about the mom was abusing her daughter. >> Yes. >> And what he said was, "How can how can she abuse her own child? I can't believe it." He said that multiple times. I was very surprised and confused. Is this because my dad doesn't remember the memory of what he had done or because he lives in present? >> All right. And so do you wish to hold on to that or let it go? >> I want to let it go. >> All right. Then forgive. Remember, it doesn't condone the action to forgive. You can still recognize the action that someone took as a negative fear-based action because they didn't know any better because it takes a victim to make a victim. And therefore, being in fear, being victimized himself, he didn't know how to express the idea of connection and love in a positive way. You don't need to continue to connect yourself to that experience. you can move on and have the compassion to forgive. Because again, remember the original definition of forgiveness is to no longer need revenge, to no longer need to punish someone for what they've done >> because that only keeps you connected to the negative energy and then you are punishing and abusing yourself from that point forward. So do not abuse yourself. Let it go. Forgive and move forward. >> So if I forgive, I don't remember this memory anymore. >> You may or may not, but you can use it to learn from. If you forgive, you will simply be free to be who you wish to be. Forgiveness is freedom. You are no longer shackled to the idea of a so-called past that is simply no longer your past. If you become a different person, you have a different past. Do you understand this concept? >> Yes. >> All right. So be the person you prefer to be now, knowing that you can use what you do, remember to push you in the direction that is opposite, to push you in the direction of being your true self, to push you in the direction of freedom and love. And therefore, even though he may not have known what he was doing, he still pushed you in that direction. So use it in a positive way and let it go. >> Okay. >> Does that help you? >> It helped me. >> All right. >> Last question. >> Yes. Can you please describe how my higher self looks like or how >> why do you need to know how your higher self looks other than again as an orb of light >> or the character >> for what? >> The character. >> The character. Is that what you're saying? >> Yes. >> What do you mean by character? Is there is higher self have a character? >> You are part of the higher self. Remember the higher self is just a portion of you that is still in spirit and all of you is still in spirit. You're just dreaming that you're not. >> Mhm. >> So how does the higher self feel to you? >> Feel to me. >> Speak up. feel to me? >> How does it feel to you? How does the higher self feel? >> Strong. >> Strong. Therefore, you are strong and that is its character. It is loving unconditionally. It is guiding you unairringly by sending you vibrational messages that translate through your body as passion, excitement, creativity, attraction, love >> constantly guiding. It is a guiding light. Follow it. Act on it. It is absolutely an indestructible core of strength. So be strong. >> Okay. >> Be yourself. >> Last question. I just want to make sure the forgive is letting go. It is not condoning the idea of a negative perpetration, but it is letting go. It's freeing yourself and disconnecting from that so it doesn't hold you back because otherwise you're just perpetuating it. >> How can work on that? How can I work on that? >> You don't work on it. You just let it go. >> Do you want to remain connected to the idea of abusing yourself? H >> do you want to continue to abuse yourself? >> No. >> Then stop. That's it. It's that easy. >> So >> move forward. >> So if I think if I imaginate it, I just don't think about it. >> Say again. >> If I thought about it, I just stop thinking about it. >> It's not stopping to think about it. It's letting it go in terms of any effect that it has on you negatively. You are free from it. You can think about it. You can remember it. It doesn't matter. You might forget about it, but it doesn't matter. Remember, it's not about what happens. It's about what you do with what happens that makes the difference in your world. >> So again, we're not saying that you condone what happened, but the idea is that you can forgive in order to free yourself so that you are not continuing the abuse on yourself. Yes. >> Yes. >> It's not about forgetting the incident. >> It's about forgiving yourself. >> Okay. >> All right. >> Thank you. >> You are welcome. >> Hello Bashar. >> And you good day. So, I heard about your um copper ball experiment. Yes. Where you measure the resonance of a copper ball in one location another and then blast it with the subtracted difference to get the um conductive ball to roll around. >> Yes. I was wondering if it would be possible to instead of measuring these subtle frequencies to simply pick a frequency range and blast the ball with that frequency and experiment with different linear frequencies or just like a linear sweep and a combination sweep to see if we could get it to roll around without actually measuring it in the first place. >> Sure. So if you change just one frequency of the locationational variable, does that automatically result in a total change of the location or are the different like subcomponents of the locationational variable kind of connected together? >> There are subcomponents which is why in your case the ball would roll around as opposed to simply disappearing at point A and reappearing at point B. >> Okay. So >> your technology is not precise enough yet. >> Precise enough to blast it or precise enough to measure it. >> It's not precise enough to get it to disappear from point A and appear at point B. >> So not Okay. >> So the effect would be that it would simply roll from point A to point B and stop. >> Okay. Um, so do we have so the frequency that we blast the object with, does it have to be close enough to one of the constituent frequencies that the object already has or can it literally be any frequency, say below 400 cycles per second? >> No, no, no, no. You are making the object resonate and measuring that frequency in one location and then moving it to the second location, making the object resonate and measuring that frequency and then measuring the difference between them. >> Right? But because our equipment isn't sensitive enough to measure the um like those types of vibrations yet or you're unsure. >> No, it is. It is. That's why we gave you the experiment. >> Okay. >> You just have to use sophisticated equipment. >> Okay. Okay. Um All right. So, I wanted to share an um an observation that I made about frequency harmonics. >> Yes. >> So, if you take this value of 3.69303 69303 meghertz. So synchronistic numbers and you repeatedly step it down with golden ratio increments using divisions. Then we encounter a lot of important frequencies. For example, 333 kHz and also the heart and the root sulfagio frequencies 639 and 396 um cycles per second. So I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about um this harmonic and potential applications of it. >> Nope. >> Okay. Then I'll ask um >> not our job at the moment. >> Okay. So you wouldn't be able to tell me if this highest frequency is the necessary frequency for the outermost shell of um of of the Sison free energy device. We are no longer allowed to comment on the information we have given about the free energy devices at this time. >> Okay. Thank you for establishing that. >> Um I was wondering at this point how far above rock is your ship. >> 700 ft. >> Still 700. Okay. Wonderful. You are clapping as if you could reach up and touch us. >> Okay. Um, so from a linear standpoint, I was wondering what percent of the people in this room have a what would seem to be a future incarnation as a member of the Essani? 39%. >> 39%. Wow. Um, am I one of the 39%. Since you asked. >> Yes. >> Wonderful. So, it doesn't mean that you're in my contemporary time frame. >> Okay. Okay. So, different timeline, but same civilization. >> Yes. >> Okay. >> In which the counterpart is in fact a technician. >> A technician. >> Wonderful. Um, yeah, that would make sense. >> I was >> Maybe you can ask him the questions that you're asking. I would love that opportunity. Yes. Um, I was wondering I know you said that this will decrease my frequency, but just so I know, I was wondering if you could give me a frequency reading as well. I know you said this will hurt, but I was just wondering. I can take the pain. 139,000 cycles per second. All right. >> It was 143,000. >> Okay. All right. Um, >> say ouch. >> All right. That will be all for now for me. Thank you so much. >> Thank you. >> I love you very much. >> And you good day. >> Um, I would like to know if you can give me an insight. Um, when I was about 9 years old, I had a near drowning experience. >> How exciting. >> And at the moment of losing consciousness, does that is that what death feels like? >> It can. Yes. Really? In a sense, death can feel just like walking through a doorway. >> At that time when I became two again, I guess I must have shift. >> Yes. So you can when that moment of so I I you can't >> you were given a choice to stay in spirit or to continue your life in a parallel reality so similar you didn't notice it wasn't the same reality >> but you you can't tell if that moment of losing consciousness if that what death felt like. >> Yes. Because you died. >> So literally at that time >> literally you died >> physical death. >> Yes. and you were given an opportunity to stay in spirit or to continue the life as if you hadn't died. But the only way to do that is in a parallel reality that's so similar you don't know the difference. >> Okay. Thank you. >> You understand? >> Yes. Thank you. Um um a question about sleep. >> Yes. >> Is no offense to you, but usually when I fall asleep, I mean when I listen to channel messages, I often fall asleep. >> That's fine. Were you here last night of your time? >> Yes. Did you hear us say that sometimes people respond by falling asleep so they can get their conscious mind out of the way and allow the information to be absorbed in the way they need to be absorbed? >> Okay. Yes. >> So, it's a natural reaction sometimes to the energy that we give off or higher energy frequencies because you know that your physical mind brings with it all sorts of filters and assumptions and definitions that don't necessarily work for the vibrational energy you wish to absorb. So, you put it to sleep. You go sh go to sleep. Go to sleep. And then your higher mind can pay attention, absorb what it needs to and give that and deliver that to the physical mind in the way it needs to by whispering to it while it's sleeping gently telling it lovely bedtime stories that allow it to absorb the information in a palatable way, a comfortable way, an enjoyable way, so that when the physical mind wakes up, it'll go, "Oh, well, I feel pretty good. I don't know why but I feel different. >> Yeah. Okay. Great. Thank you. Um also can you um give a little p like how to develop an inner joy in your heart. >> Oh sorry I was asleep. >> I'm trying to I'm trying to word it so it just exact. So to how to develop the inner joy in your heart. >> Oh, I apologize. What were you saying? >> All right, I'm listening. >> Okay. So how to develop the inner joy in your heart and in your mind and that synchronize them together and >> well how do you imagine that might work for you? This is your ability to design a permission slip that will allow you to feel the communion and communication between the heart and the mind in a balanced way. So this is your opportunity to use your imagination to design whatever permission slip will allow you to feel and believe that you are balancing the energy between your heart and mind. So what do you want to do? This is your chance right now to choose an extraordinary life to choose an extraordinary permission slip through your extraordinary imagination. What do you imagine would allow you to experience what it is you seek? Be extraordinary right now. Um, >> come on. You can do it. I know you can. Use that imagination. Be creative. Picture. How does that work? Do you see the heart? Do you see the mind? How are they represented? Can you see them talking to each other, blending together? What works for you? Come on, open up your imagination. >> Okay. So, um, usually I can get my heart to be in joy. Not all the time, periodically. Is that how you want to define this permission slip? I can't do it all the time. Is that the way you want to design the permission slip that you can't do it all the time? >> I I >> watch your definitions, >> right? It's not that I can't do I'm not always thinking about it all the time. >> You don't have to think about it all the time. >> So just get just tell yourself that it's there all the time. Then it's there all the time. >> No, not just tell yourself know that it is. >> Right. And then >> there's a difference. Okay. Know that it's there all the time and then send it to your to your mind and have your mind also know that the joy is there all the time together with the heart. >> Does that feel correct to you? Yes. >> Or would you like to make some adjustments in that >> to really experience it >> and by experiencing it? How will you experience it once you know that? How will you experience it? There's a simple answer. by um being peaceful and >> Nope. >> Just feeling the happiness. >> Nope. You already talked about feeling the happiness. >> Uhhuh. >> But the idea is how will you ground this in your physical reality? If you know this will work for you and you desire to experience the fact that it will work for you, how will you ground this knowledge in physical reality? >> Just tell yourself >> you will act like you know it's true. >> Yes. >> Because knowledge and action are synonymous. What you know to be true is in your behavior. You don't think about it. You don't wonder about it. You don't say, "Do I believe this is true?" You just do what you know is true. Have you not seen us give this demonstration before? >> Okay. >> Have you? >> No. >> Do you have a small object? Pen, pencil, coin, anything? >> Yes. >> Do you have it in your hand? >> Uh, >> put it in your hand. A ring, jewelry, anything? >> Yes. >> Do you have it in your hand? >> Yes. >> Put it on the floor. >> Oh, I think I remember seeing this. Belle, put it on the floor. >> Okay. >> Did you do it? >> Yes. >> Now, pick it up. >> Did you do it? >> Yes. >> Did you think about it or did you just do it? Did you ask yourself if you believed you could pick it up? No. You just picked it up. >> Yes. Thank you. >> What you know is true. You just do. >> Knowledge and behavior are synonymous. >> Okay. So if you know that this permission slip will work for you and you are in the state that you prefer to be in, the only way to experience it in physical reality to ground it in physical reality is to behave like you know it's true. Make it synonymous with your action because the knowledge and the action are simply two sides of the same coin. >> Okay. Thank you. Yes. >> Does that help you? >> Yes. Thank you. Does that help you? >> All right. Thank you. >> Thank you. I have a question from my daughter. She wants to ask you where does the source comes from? >> The source of all that is. >> Yes. Where >> comes from here. It comes from now. There is no other place or time. >> It's so that means the source is always here. Has been here. Is >> always >> time and space are subject to existence. Existence is not subject to time and space. There is no beginning to existence and no end. It is simply here. It is simply now. That's what it is. And everything else is subject to that. It doesn't need to have a beginning because it's not subject to the idea of time. >> Okay? >> So it's just here. It's just now. It is everything you see. It is everywhere. Every when it is all that is. >> Okay. All right. Thank you. And that means that so are you and so is she. >> Right? >> Yes. Everything you experience will always be from your point of view, from your identity. Even when you think about the experience of blending, as you often say, with all that is, that doesn't mean you lose your identity. It means you're the only identity left. You are all that is. When you blend with all that is, you see everything from that point of view. But you're still you. You're your version of all that is. Just like everyone else will experience themselves as their version of all that is. That's what it means to be a multi-dimensional being. >> Everyone can experience themselves as all that is. And all that is experiences itself as all of us experiencing themselves as aspects of all that is and experiencing themselves as their version of all that is. And all those versions together also make up another all that is experiencing all the versions of all that is that all that is can be. And that version can experience itself as other versions of all that is experiencing all that is experiencing all that is experiencing all that is experiencing all that is. You get the point? >> Yes. >> Thank you. >> Thank you. >> Thank you. >> Hello Bashar. >> Annie you good day. >> This is really cool. Um okay. This is a question about my physical body. Oh, >> we are checking the temperature. >> You said it was cool. >> Oh, it's it's it's hot or I don't know. >> It's hot and cool. >> Sort of hot and cool. Okay. Okay. Well, anyway, I'm sweating, but my hands are cold. Okay. >> Speak up. >> Um, I probably know the answer, but I foundation. >> Um, I created a motor vehicle accident. >> No. All right. How exciting for you? >> Yeah, it was pretty exciting. >> Did it jar you awake into a new understanding of yourself? >> It really did. >> All right. It connected me with Yes. Yes. Thank you. >> You're welcome. >> Um, so I injured as a result I injured my spine. Um, a piece of my vertebrae broke off. >> All right. >> The only reason I found that out was because I did go to ER, but after that I made a decision that I wasn't going to, you know, utilize that healing modality. >> Oh, all right. And you can use the detoxification modality if you wish. >> What is that? >> There are very strong formulations of detoxification that will remove the toxins from your system. And when you then remove the toxins from your system and put in the proper nutrients, your body can heal itself even from an injury like that. >> So detoxify your body as thoroughly as possible if you wish. This information can be given to you later after this transmission because there are many different forms of detoxification. But because we often get this question, we have already directed the channel to research and explore certain companies on your planet that provide extremely strong detoxification programs and there will be someone who can give you this information once this is over or even during this particular transmission if you wish. >> Oh, thank you so much. Thank you. Okay, my next question is um I utilized uh different healing modalities and one of the ones that I completely resonated with um is with an angelic beings. Yes. >> And um you know with utmost respect and love what are angels? >> Angels are the first reflection of all that is. >> Does that make sense to you in your language? >> All that is in a sense everything that exists is a reflection from some particular point of view of all that is. Angels are the first reflection. >> Yes. that allow all that is to know itself as all that is. >> You could say it's the first layer of the onion. >> Does that make sense? >> Yes. >> Of the consciousness of all that is. But it expresses itself individually in well all right if you want many gods so to speak which you call the angelic realm. It's reflections. It's mirrors of all that is individuated mirrors. Individuated representations of all that is on a very high level. The first level, the first split, the first reflection. >> Makes sense. >> Thank you so much. >> Well, you're so welcome. I had nothing to do with that. >> Much love. That's it. >> Unconditional love to you. >> Good day, Bashar. >> You good day. >> And good day to you all. >> I love you. Our love to you as well. >> Um my first question Bashar, it's about um anxiety or panic attacks. >> Anxiety and panic attack. >> Yeah. Sometimes >> how exciting. >> Yeah. Sometimes I have experienced those things that >> Well, what's holding you back from being yourself? What are you afraid of? >> Um I don't know. >> Oh, don't give me that. Of course you do. Or certainly it's easy to find out >> because again all you have to do is ask the question and be willing to hear the answer. What am I afraid will happen if I am my authentic self? If I allow myself to be who I prefer to be? What am I terrified might happen? Well, >> um >> what are you afraid will happen? What are you anxious about? Uh, I get like all these thoughts of like maybe going crazy or something like that. >> Going crazy. >> Yeah. >> Well, why do you have definitions that would say that to be yourself would make you crazy? >> That's not a definition of your authentic self. >> Wouldn't a definition of your authentic self simply allow you to be balanced and joyful? Wouldn't that be a more appropriate definition of the authentic self? >> Yep. So, why are you holding on to a definition of your true self that says that your true self would somehow automatically be crazy in a negative way? Why are you holding that definition to be true? It makes no sense. >> Um, like right now I think like I'm quite balanced, but I don't know if it's part of like changing change on my body and my physical body. >> Well, so what if it is? That's not necessarily a negative thing, is it? >> Nope. Well, then why would that lead to anxiety? >> Um, >> you do understand that you can't have a feeling without a definition first. Yes. >> Yes. >> All right. So, what definition would have to be true about you in order for you to be feeling anxious about yourself? >> What are you buying into that you think is true? It's not true because it's out of alignment with who you are. But if you're buying into the idea of something out of alignment being true, you're going to feel anxious. Do you not understand? Anxiety is the emotion's way of telling you you have a definition that's out of alignment. It's doing a service by pointing it out to you, by bringing it to your attention. Don't get caught up in the feeling, oh, I'm feeling anxiety. That's a bad thing. No, because then you're only heaping more negativity as a definition on the experience of anxiety. If you understand that anxiety is just the way in which you're experiencing your energy because you're filtering your energy through a negative definition, then you can say, "Oh, thank you, anxiety, for pointing out that I'm out of alignment and out of balance with who I prefer to be. Thank you for bringing it to my attention." Now, what would I have to believe is true in order to be generating anxiety by filtering my energy through this negative definition? what would that negative definition have to be about myself? Then you can be in touch. If you're willing to hear the answer, then something in your life will bring the answer to you. If you're not afraid to hear the answer, too. And if you are, then there's another belief you need to deal with and identify. >> But that's all it takes is understanding what anxiety is there for and not getting caught up in the fact that, oh, I'm experiencing anxiety. Something must be wrong. No, something's very right. That's the point. Something is very right. Your emotional system is working perfectly by pointing out that you have a definition that isn't working for you. That's why you're feeling the anxiety. That means it's working fine. It only starts to seem like it's not working when you get caught up in the fact that the anxiety is there and label it inappropriately as something's going wrong. No, something's going right. Use it. And then you will see that it will disappear. Because anytime a messenger of emotionality comes to you, fear, anxiety, self-doubt, what have you, anytime it raises its head, it's telling you you need to find something there that's generating it. And when you say, "Thank you for bringing that to my attention. I will now pay attention to what you're saying and go exploring and find out what that definition is." Then the fear, the anxiety, the self-doubt will have done its job and it will turn into curiosity and imagination and investigation and discovery and excitement. It's the same energy as your joy. It's just that it's your joy being filtered through something that's out of alignment. So, of course, it's going to be discordant, but it's your energy. The fact that it's discordant allows you to know you're out of tune and to bring yourself back into tune. So, when you feel these things, these so-called negative energies, that means your system is working perfectly as a guidance mechanism to let you know there's something you need to adjust to bring yourself back into tune. Does that make sense? >> Yes. Perfect sense. >> All right. Then use it that way and you will experience the result of that. >> That's all it is. It's your guidance mechanism. Treat it as such and it will serve you as such. >> Yes. >> Okay. Thank you very much, Bashar. Thank you. >> I have another question. >> Yes. >> Okay. Uh regarding about this uh natural substance about regenerating the myelin and the nervous system. Yes. Can you give me a hint of >> because this has to be discovered by you because there are many things that could do this but you have to choose and attract yourself to the process that will work best for you just as that other person has to do that for herself because there are different ways this can be done. and we will not pin you down to one specific way. I will tell you both again what we told the last person is that one of the first stages that will aid and assist you in any such replenishment process is to first thoroughly detoxify your system so that your cells are not jammed with toxins that prevent the nutrients from lodging in the cells. If you flush the cells out and let the toxins go out of your body, then the cells are capable of absorbing whatever nutrients you put in that will then help replenish and balance the body. So detoxification may be the first step for all of these questions and then you can discover for yourself what will work as the nutrients you need to put in to allow the body to heal itself. All right. >> All right. >> All right. Well, thank you so very much. >> Thank you very much for my love to you all. All
