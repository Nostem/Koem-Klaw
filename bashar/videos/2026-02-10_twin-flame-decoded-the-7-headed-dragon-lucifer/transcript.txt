Hi Bashar. >> Andrew you. Good day. >> How are you doing? Good. >> Perfect. And you? >> Yeah, I'm doing fantastic. Thank you for I'm really really honored to have a the chance to have a conversation with you today. >> It is our honor as well and our passion and our pleasure. What would you like to discuss? >> There's a few things I have in mind. Um, I've been following your content for quite some times and you know just to provide a bit of context I in 2010 I started an agent a design agency specialized in uh building impact solutions. So helping companies uh define their purpose and then translate that purpose into sustainable and socially impactful business models. >> All right. >> It's been uh quite the learning journey. um al and and to me to adopt new practices uh you need to create attractive solutions. So I'd really dedicated myself at building uh co-creative models uh to help uh you know meet our clients where they were and then help co-create maybe a better future for everyone. >> All right. Thank you for your service. >> Thank you. So, it's been it's been a learning journey, but now that you know 14 years into it, I'm realizing that uh I've been going a lot against the grain. Um you know, trying to >> Well, how can you go more with the flow? >> So, >> how can you go more with the flow? >> Exactly. >> Use your creativity and imagination. What would you rather be doing? Or how would you rather be doing it? If it is representative of your passion, there is always a way to be doing your passion in the most passionate way. So, how could you be doing it differently than you're doing it now? I've started to play around with the idea of instead of trying to change others to really build, you know, build the the visions myself. >> Yes. Well, you can't really change others, you can offer them the opportunity to change, but they have to be the ones to make that decision. So, if you've been going about it with the idea that you're supposed to be changing them, then dropping that idea would help you flow more because it's all well and good to share with others what you think might be willing to help them. But what they do with the information is none of your business because you don't know their path. So, the idea is to stop focusing on needing to change them and just simply offer them things that you're excited to offer because that's who you are. and let them decide whether or not to take those things. >> Makes a lot of sense. >> Yes, it does. That's why I said it. It removes the weight off your shoulders and the burden that many people on your planet create for themselves of needing others to change. You can't need others to change. You can only offer them the opportunity to change, but you must leave it up to them to decide whether or not to match that frequency. whether or not to incorporate that change in their own lives. It's not your responsibility to make sure that they do. That's not your job. Your job is to be yourself, to give off the gifts that you have to give, to offer them to others as potential things that may assist them, but you absolutely have to leave it up to them to decide to incorporate them. That's none of your business. Thank you for sharing that. Uh segueing into responsibility, I've been carrying the the weight of responsibility for quite some times. Uh it has guided some of my decisions. Uh you know, if even if I embarked in that on that, you know, impact journey over over the years was because I wanted my kids to have a planet to enjoy in the future. >> Yes. But you remember you never change the planet you're on. You change your frequency and you shift to another version of Earth that is already more representative of the frequency change you made within yourself. M >> so teaching them how to change their frequency, how to navigate through all those different versions of parallel reality earths by following the formula is how they will experience the idea of a version of earth that is more representative of the joy that they create within themselves and the actions that they take that are representative of that joy. But you can't be responsible for others. You can only be responsible to them to be yourself and be the living example of how they could also choose to be like you. >> Mhm. >> To teach them the consequences of choices in a safe and creative way. So they understand how everything is connected, how everything is synchronicity and how to move through the different parallel versions of Earth by following the formula, by being self-empowered, by knowing that they can attract anything they need in life to fulfill themselves without having to hurt themselves or anyone else in order to do so. And to not be responsible for others, but to be responsible to them by also being living examples of what other people can also by seeing their example choose to incorporate within their own lives as well, but to not need them to do so. Remember, you act on your passion for its own sake, not because of what you think it's going to cause or get you. Otherwise, you're making your passion conditional on what other people do. Thank you. Thank you for that. That's uh that makes a lot of sense. >> There's always a bit of a a discrepancy between, you know, my intentions to act on my highest excitement and uh the the the short-term conditions I feel I need to go through. >> Yes. But you see that's contradictory as you said because if you have conditions that are outside conditions then you're not acting on your passion >> because true vibration of passion is not reliant on exterior conditions. That's why I'm saying you act on your passion for its own sake because that's who you are because you have no other choice. Not because of what it's going to get you. Not because of how other people are going to react. That's an outside condition and that dampens the idea of your excitement of your passion because now it's not pure. >> Maybe one last uh thing if if I may uh >> it's really connected with that same topic where you know I feel responsible to you know I I jumped into that on that journey which was really fulfilling obviously but to to translate these values to my children. I have two kids and um >> if you'd look at my son, you'd see I'm the greatest parent. If you look at my daughter, you might think otherwise. >> Uh she comes with a bit of um anxiety uh baggage and I'm really trying really hard to connect >> about what anxiety about what >> uh the our focus is really on the uh perception of others. >> What is her age? 14. >> All right. Have you had any talks with her about the idea of why she thinks it's important to gauge herself based on what other people think? >> I've tried I've tried to break that shell, but she's really pushing me back. >> Why? What does she get out of it? Have you asked her that? >> Um I've tried many many times. Uh but what I get from that uh it's again my perception is that um she's uh she's a bit insecure on what other people would think. So she's pushing her parents especially her dad away uh because it makes her look a bit more immature with her group of friends. That's one of the the idea that has crossed my mind. Uh but honestly I don't know. >> Have you told her that you love her unconditionally? no matter what she does >> on a daily base. >> All right, then keep doing so and let her go through her process. >> Okay, >> just be there for her when she needs you to be. You don't have to push. You don't have to try and change her. Just understand that she has chosen a path, chosen a journey. She can learn eventually, but you have to let her go through her journey. You have to let her go through her path. >> Just be there for her. >> The hardest thing. >> Well, it should be the easiest thing if you truly trust that she is a strong soul. Don't see her as weak. See her as strong. See her as exploring a certain idea. Whether it's positive or negative to you, doesn't matter. She's exploring. Just be there for her. Just tell her that I'm here for you. Whatever it is you decide to do, however it is you decide to be, I'm here for you. And I know you have a strong soul. And I trust that you will go through whatever you're going through in a way that will serve you best. But I'm here for you if you need me. If not, then I'm still here for you unconditionally. If you can say that, then perhaps she will lighten up. I'll try that. >> All right. Does that serve you at this time? >> It does. Thank you so much for uh for this uh great sharing. >> It is our passion and our pleasure. Ao >> hi. >> Good day. Good day. What would you like to discuss with us this day? Uh, can you tell me uh what the sevenheaded dragon aka Lucifer and the dragon's tail sweeping in the book of revelations and the year of the dragon and charity sergeant star magic and the dragon's eye while you're meditating when you see one. What do they all have in common? They are archetypal symbols of the journey of humanity in processing the different personality types that are investigating fear-based beliefs, negative beliefs, and transforming them into a positive understanding and creating an evolutionary path for yourself to reclaim your true power. >> Wow. That was large. >> All right, if you say so. >> It was [laughter] um how can we raise the frequency of our food? Like we can do the same thing to water. So when we say grace, should we actually be saying benevolent things about the food? >> You can. >> You can. But also remember that when you raise your own frequency, what you will be attracted to eat will be the things of higher frequency automatically. >> Yeah, I do understand that. And that's the end of the grace or prayer. Um, should we or should we not say the word amen? Because there's a reference that it might be praising Amen Ra who professed to be God, but he's not all that is. >> It will give whatever meaning you give to it. It actually simply means so be it. >> Oh, okay. That was nice. >> Whatever you decide is the definition that works for you. You can say whatever you wish. It's just a permission slip. Remember that prayer grace is a state of appreciation for what you have in the present. That's all it is. A state of appreciation and gratitude for what you are and what you have right here and right now. That's all it is. That's a high vibrational frequency that will attract high vibrational frequency things in physical reality as representations of the frequency you have taken yourself to. >> Okay? >> So it is an attitude of gratitude and thanks for who you are and what you attract as the lessons you need to learn in life. >> Okay. Um, did I have an outofbody experience uh when I had read a Sylvia Brown book and followed the directions? And >> yes, you have out-of body experiences like everyone all the time, especially when you are asleep physically. You don't necessarily remember all of them, but by focusing yourself on certain information that had to do with it, you may have given yourself the opportunity to remember some of the outof body experience that you have had. >> Yeah. Because coming back, I felt like I was levitating about 3 feet above my bed and slammed into my bed when I woke up. >> Yes. Oh, and then recently I woke up really suddenly because I realized I was in a black space and if that is an out-of- body experience and if that happens again, how can I relax myself and not be so scared and wake myself up? >> Well, what were you afraid of? >> I don't know. I just remember it was just black and then suddenly I woke up and I knew I was in fear. But then I realized, well, >> all right, >> there is nothing to be afraid of. You may have been facing the idea of what people on your planet typically call the shadow self. Coming to terms with the idea of any fear-based beliefs you may still be holding on to because those things can come up when you start to increase your frequency. When you start to shift to higher dimensions, you have to let go of those things. And letting go of those things, those remnants of fear-based beliefs that may exist in your physical mind can create the idea of having to face them, having to truly understand why you're holding on to them or why you were. So, increasing your frequency may put you face to face with beliefs you have to let go of. >> Yes. Okay. Um, so I've had some supernatural things that happen in my life and here's >> I understand what you mean by that, but everything is natural, even what you refer to as supernatural. >> Okay. Well, one little one is I saw, you know, how the tuna cans, they can stack up on top of each other. Yeah. >> I had three of them in my cupboard and I was about eight feet away from my cupboard. I literally saw the tuna can jump off and land next to it. So I was like, "What energy did that?" >> You did. >> Oh, cool. >> There are moments when humans will slip into a higher frequency state and recognize that they are creating literally creating the projection of their physical reality. And so in that moment of unguardedness, you may have become more of your true self and demonstrated to yourself how you actually can manipulate physical reality because it's your projection anyway. >> That's amazing. So you will give yourself these little markers from time to time to remind you that physical reality is extremely malleable, plastic and flexible and that you are creating it moment to moment. And that if you stop focusing so strongly on the idea of only being in physical reality, only focused on physical reality, you can from time to time see physical reality shift itself in ways that seem quite magical. >> So that might be one of my gifts then that I'm not aware of. It's a gift you all have, but it comes with the awareness that you are creating your physical reality and not being afraid to allow it to be reflective of the true way in which you are actually generating it. >> Okay. [clears throat] Um, I had a dream that my husband and I were walking into a venue where we were going to I was going to perform because I'm a singer and we're bringing the gear in and suddenly the warehouse changes into or the place changes into a warehouse and it's very dark but the walls are glass and I can look over and see the next building over and the people are screaming and running out. >> Yes. >> And I'm calm. My husband is kind of sketchy, but then he realizes he can be calm because I'm calm. >> Yes. >> Um is was that a premonition of an unveiling? It is the recognition of what we have called the splitting prism of different realities that are separated by analogous glass walls where you can see other realities where people may be choosing things that are not your preferred vibration but they can't affect you because they can't get through the glass wall even though you can see them. >> So it's a recognition that you are in your own reality. >> Yes. Okay. that there is nothing to fear by observing what other people may be choosing in their realities that is not your vibrational preference because you have to match their frequency in order to experience what they're experiencing. >> Right? Which leads me to back when I was a kid, I used to think, do is the color purple to me the same color as the color purple to them? And then what I see is the shape of a human is is that what they see? >> Not always. It might be similar but it may not be identical because again each of you have your own reality and your own interpretation of what you are creating as an interface in order to interact with other beings, other consciousnesses. But what you are interacting with is your created interface that makes sense to you that is relevant as a reflection to you. So it might be very similar but it may not be identical. >> Okay. And as a child I used to be super excited about going to bed because I would always dream of floating up. >> Yes. Out of body experiences. >> Oh, okay. Yeah. The silver cord and I just it was like just felt so wonderful. >> Yes. Well, this is natural for all of you to do. Not all of you remember doing that, but it's something that you all definitely do when you're asleep because you're going back to your natural state because you have calmed down the physical consciousness, the physical focus, and you can become more of yourself, which is naturally spirit, non-physical. The physical silver cord is simply one way of interpreting the idea that you're still connected to a physical experience. You haven't severed that tie. You're not going back completely into the idea of waking up into spirit. You're still maintaining a connection to the experience of physical reality which happens within your soul. >> Kind of like the movie Avatar. >> Kind of as a simplistic analogy. >> Yeah. Yeah. For sure. Last question. Um I don't know if you can answer it. Uh has my sister Jenny reincarnated somewhere? And if so, where and what's she doing? >> Well, you understand that incarnation is multiple simultaneous carnations, not reincarnation literally in a linear sense, >> right? >> Everything exists at the same time. >> Yeah. So that soul can be having other experiences, but it's not literally reincarnation in the way that most people on your planet mean it. >> So you will always be able to contact the spirit of that being even if they are experiencing something that to you would represent another incarnation. >> Right? Okay. So whether or not they're in physical form or a non-physical form, I can always contact them. >> Yes. Because every form always exists and every form exists at the same time. So whatever way in which it is easiest for you to understand how to make that connection, you can use that to make that connection and that part of the being will always be available to you no matter what else they may be choosing to do. Because remember that spirits are multi-dimensional beings. Do you happen to know what her little signs are? Like some people say pennies or feathers, but does she have a particular sign? >> Well, what has occurred in your synchronicity that reminds you of her? Can you remember any instance of simply going about your day and suddenly something just reminded you you of her out of the blue as you say? >> Oh, for sure. Like the things that she's made me and sewing and her laughter and stuff. So, >> all right. then those things can be the signs that she may use because the things that you remind yourself of her with are the things that she would most likely use to get in touch with you. >> Okay. All right. Well, thank you very much. >> You are welcome very much. A >> hello team Bashar. My name is Michael Boove and um uh through following the formula as best I can uh I realized that I had a negative belief that basically was saying I can't create what I need or you know distilled completely down to I'm separate from all that is which I know is not true. Um and then um through recently focusing on using the AAA formula in the last month, I realized um after seeing Bashar at the last CL that I have a reinforcing mechanism that is saying that if I do get what I need or prefer that it's actually going to cause more suffering. So my question is can I continue just using the AAA formula, will that be enough or do I need bigger guns? Do I need a bigger permission slip or some insight from Bashar that would help me finally let go of these fear-based beliefs that I've been using and believing my whole life? Thank you so much. >> You can continue to use the AAA formula, but at the same time, what you really need to do is have deeper investigation into the motivational mechanism of why you would continue to hold on to something you say you don't prefer. So you have to ask yourself what you're getting out of holding on to it because you believe something worse would happen if you let it go. That's the key. The motivational mechanism of understanding what you believe would be the worst thing that would happen if you let go of holding on to the negative thing you're holding on to because you believe that somehow holding on to that thing you don't prefer is actually serving you better than letting it go. You are afraid that letting it go would cause something worse to happen. You've said so in your question. So it's the motivational mechanism that is the key of understanding and you have to find out what it is you think holding on to this negative thing is preventing you from experiencing that would be worse. So you need more deeper honest self-investigation as to what that would be and why you think something worse would happen and what that worst thing would be. It's not a fact. It's just a story. You have to really wrap your mind around that. It's not a fact that something worse will happen. It's just a story. But you're telling yourself that story or buying into that story and believing that story. And so it feels safer to hold on to what you're holding on to even if you don't prefer it because again, you keep believing that the alternative would be worse. So you need to clarify what that actually is to you. Good day. Hi Michelle. >> Good day. What would you like to discuss with us this day? >> I would like to talk to you about counterparts. >> Yes. >> So um I previously discussed with you and I have a counterpart and um and I made the choice to sort of separate space because the relationship wasn't aligned. >> All right. Sometimes counterparts are for that purpose. >> Yes. So I kind of wanted to ask you reading my energy if sort of you can read that I have met my agreement if my side of the street is clean. >> By asking the question we would assume that you don't necessarily think that it is. >> Well I just don't know. I mean I have done everything I could >> to do what? >> Sorry. to do what? >> Meaning like I did everything I could in the relationship to >> be as real and as honest and to end it as like sincerely as possible >> that you have previously said that sometimes counterparts have like agreements. >> Yes. But that can be the agreement too. >> Yes. Walking away can be part of the agreement. And sometimes it's the most loving thing you can do because you're showing the other being the consequences of the choices that they're making that may be vibrationally incompatible with the choices that you prefer. Thus giving them the opportunity to either change or continue along the path that they are continuing which would perpetuate the idea of separation between you physically. >> Yes. And so I was just sort of saying can you look at my energy and know anything about that agreement. >> I know what you are saying and what I'm saying is if what I have just said align with you then you're doing fine. >> Okay. Great. All right. Thank you. All right. So I had a dream and in the dream there were three black panthers and a tiger and I have spoken to you about my dreams and I'm visited by many big cats. In this dream, I I've made peace with Tiger. I still have fear about Jaguar and and apparently I have fear about Black Panther because in this dream there were three Black Panthers and a tiger and the tiger came close almost sort of to sort of introduce them and the Black Panthers stayed in the back and then I woke up. >> Are you afraid of your own power? >> Sure. >> Why? What do you mean sure? I mean, >> why are you afraid of your own power? What are you afraid might happen if you express your power? >> What is power in your definition? >> The ability to be your authentic self. >> Am I afraid to be my authentic self? >> Yes. Are you afraid of any reactions that might occur in your society being your authentic self? Are you afraid to follow your passion? Are you afraid of any kind of response to following your passion? >> Okay, the way that I can answer this is I must be right because I have the fear. Um, >> well, what are you afraid will happen if you do follow your passion? >> Probably just failure. That's the first thing that came to mind. How can you fail by following your passion? Those two concepts do not go together. Well, what if how does it >> in other words in other words in other words if you have an insistence or an assumption as to what you think the outcome of following your passion might be and you don't achieve the outcome you insisted upon, you're going to call that a failure. But this is why the formula says to have no insistence and no assumption as to what the outcome might be of acting on your passion. Because the real truth, the authentic truth is, even though sometimes you may guess correctly what the outcome might be, you actually have no idea what the ideal outcome actually needs to look like. And therefore, if you simply allow synchronicity to show you what the outcome actually would be of acting on your passion and you're willing to stay in a positive state no matter what manifests, then in following the formula, your life will continue to flow. You will learn the lessons you need to learn. You will grow and expand your consciousness in that way. But if you have insistence on what you think is supposed to happen by acting on your passion, then yes, you're setting yourself up for disappointment because you're insisting that you know best what the outcome should be when the truth is you have no idea what the best outcome actually needs to look like. >> Okay. So, let me ask it like this. >> Yes. >> Is it possible I have a spiritual contract where the outcome is stuff that doesn't happen for me in the physical life? because I do follow my passion most of them. There's more passion I could follow and I will do that. However, is following your passion supposed to support you? >> Yes. >> Okay. So, what if that's not happening? >> Then what you're doing is you're limiting your definition of support because there are many forms of support. What kind of support do you think you need? the kind that allows me to pay my bills. >> Yes. So, you're focused on the form of money. >> I haven't been before to be honest. Um and >> then why are you now? >> Because I have increasing bills. [laughter] So, >> all right. And so, remember communication is a form of abundance. >> I know. Well, have you used communication to communicate with the people that you seem to owe money to? To engage them and include them in your process to let them know you have every intention of paying them, but to describe your situation and see if they're willing to change your situation in some way, shape, or form that makes it easier for you to pay what you owe. >> I could have more of those conversations. >> Then have more of them. Okay. Well, >> put yourself out there in a way that allows you to take advantage of all the different forms of abundance such as being >> advantage of every form of abundance but money. So, what does that mean? Like, what is that? >> It means you're too focused on money. >> No, meaning I use every form of abundance other than money because I I usually don't have the money. So, >> but you can't discount it. You have to include it as equal to all the other forms. You can't shut it out either. >> I know. And so, but how would I be like what mental block would I be? >> All right. Let's start from scratch. Can you name some of the expressions of your passion that you're acting on? >> Writing, singing, channeling. >> All right. Are you saying absolutely none of these are supporting you in any way, shape, or form? >> I'm not saying that. >> What are you saying? >> They support me, but they're not supporting me in a enough to support my bills. >> Can you change your situation so as to not have the bills? >> I would love to. What does that mean to you? [laughter] What would that mean to you? >> All right. Well, again, let's take it down to basics. You say that you are writing. >> Yes. >> Yes. >> What have you written? >> You I knew you were going to ask me that. I am writing. I've written books. I write pros. I write subst. I write about words. I write fiction. I write about spiritual matters. I >> All right. And you said you are channeling. >> Yes. >> You are channeling to the public. >> Yes. I just started doing life regressions per our conversation where you told me in another version of myself was acting out people's dreams. >> All right. And are you charging for your channeling? >> I'm in the Well, okay. So, maybe this is what you're telling me. I'm in a trial period because I wanted to to make sure I lit test myself and perfect my process. So, I'm >> Answer the question, please. Are you charging for your channeling? >> Not this kind. No. >> That's the problem. Is your channeling not worth it even in its present stage? >> It's definitely worth it in its present stage. >> Then why aren't you charging for it as an equal exchange? >> Well, uh, when I try out a new service, I like to do a trial and so I offer the service for free. So I have, you know, a subgroup, a test. And how long do your trials last? Obviously long enough that it leaves you incapable of paying your bills. >> Okay, I receive that. >> All right. Are you willing to charge even for the trials? And why do you think you need too much of the trial? >> I just I guess I like to make sure I'm doing things with integrity. So, I like >> Do you see what I mean by not actually expressing your authentic power? You're too hesitant. You're too unsure that you're doing something properly. Stop having trials. Just do it. >> Okay. Thank you. >> Just engage fully. Jump in. Let go of the hesitation. Let go of the uncertainty. Just do it. Be your authentic self. Ask for an equal and fair exchange from the get-go. >> From the get-go. Okay, I can do that. >> All right. >> Thank you. >> So, if you understand how to apply that to every aspect of your passion, things will change. >> I'm going to work on that. It's >> Oh, all right. work on it for as long as you wish. >> Okay. [laughter] I just mean like obviously you have to go about the process of doing the things, right? >> Yes. >> Yes. >> But without hesitation as to what they're worth. >> And how do you put a price on that? When you feel like you can walk away and feel completely satisfied and that you have offered a fair exchange to the others that you are giving your gifts to, then you will feel that it is a balance. If you walk away and feel that something is missing and you are giving yourself the indications that you cannot support yourself, then something is out of balance. >> Well, according to that, I should be charging a lot more for what I do. Maybe you should if you believe that you're worth it. >> I believe that I'm worth it. >> Do you? >> Oh, okay. Yes, I do. Here's where here's the hang. The hangup is >> knowing people are in economic straits and then charging what you're worth. Isn't there like a gap? Okay, there's a gap in reality there, right? Because >> the idea is, do you believe that what you're charging on its own is exorbitant? >> Not at this point, but if I were charging the prices that I like what it's worth, would I know it's worth? >> Yes. Do you not believe that there are people who would find that amount actually doable and equitable? >> I do. >> There will be people who won't. But are they actually your customers? Well, there are a lot of people that are the people in the most need. >> Yes. And remember that while you are charging what you believe you're worth and attracting customers that are totally happy paying that, you can at the same time offer others who cannot afford it a discount. But that doesn't mean that you have to offer the same discount to everyone, >> right? You can determine on a case-bycase basis when to share something with someone at a lower amount, but that doesn't mean you deprive yourself of what you believe you are worth for those customers who are just fine paying it. It's all about equating to different levels, being equal to different levels of exchange, and doing them all. So sometimes you can offer something for free, sometimes you can offer for something at a discount, sometimes you can offer something at full price. All of them together will support you. >> Okay. And you're saying so I at the price that I actually want to charge, I charge that and then I will be in the reality where such people who can afford those things will find me. >> Yes. Absolutely. That's how it works. And the people that can't will ask you, "May I have a discount?" And when they do, or when you get any indication that they may need what you have to share and really want what you have to share and desire it, but simply can't pay you what you have expressed is your authentic worth, then you can decide to offer them a discount. You can work it out. You can negotiate. You can be free to do that. But you can be free to do that on every level. You don't have to just be totally exclusive on one level alone. >> Yeah. I see my issue is the assumption >> of what people can do as opposed attracting >> everything. Everything. >> Yeah. Okay. Yes. >> Attract them all. >> Okay. >> You can work with each and every one of them to whatever level they are comfortable with. But the hesitation is preventing you from expressing your authenticity and getting a fair exchange for it >> for 37 years. [laughter] >> Yes. >> Okay. Well, I got to change that pronto. >> All right. Please do so if you wish. >> I will. >> Yes. >> You are welcome. Ao.
